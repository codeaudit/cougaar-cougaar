<h1>Errata for Cougaar 9.4</h1>
 <br>
 <i>The follwing infos/problems/workarounds were detected/posted after the
current version of Cougaar was built/released.<br>
 </i><br>
 
<h2>Issues:</h2>
 
<ul>
   <li>The <tt>org.cougaar.core.persist.NonPersistable</tt> interface has
been removed. This interface existed (in various packages) since an early
implementation of persistence (over four years ago). It managed to survive
through succeeding development despite that fact that it did nothing. Because
it was attracting the attention of developers and being used (and failing
to do what was expected), we decided to to remove it. This uncovered additional,
non-functioning, uses. Use the <tt>org.cougaar.core.persist.NotPersistable</tt>
 interface to mark classes whose instances should <i>not</i> be saved in
persistence snapshots. </li>
</ul>
  
<h2>New Bugs:</h2>
 
<ul>
   <li>none so far<br>
