<h1>Errata for Cougaar 9.4</h1>
 <br>
 <i>The following infos/problems/workarounds were detected/posted
after Cougaar 9.4.0 was released.<br>
 </i><br>
<h2>Minor Patch releases:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<b>cougaar-9401</b> Is cougaar 9.4.0 with new versions of core.jar,
	csmart.jar, and quo.jar.  It contains only patches
	for the following bugs:
<ul>
<li>
Bug 1596: Allow Agents created from CSMART recipes to run<br>
 OrgAssets
created using the AgentInsertionRecipe were missing the ClusterPG and
ItemIdentificationPG, resulting in runtime Exceptions. To ensure that
your Agent Insertion recipes work, be sure to open them in the
Configuration Builder, and "toggle" the value of your Agent name -
change it to something else, then change it back, and re-save your
recipe.<br>
Also note (bug 1594): An exported AgentInsertionRecipe created from a
relese pre-9.4 will show errors when you first load it from the
database, but these can be ignored.
<pre>
11:48:17,870 ERROR [AgentInsertionRecipe] - Unknown property: Include Item Identification PG=true in component AGG-Agent
11:48:17,877 ERROR [AgentInsertionRecipe] - Unknown property: Include Org Asset=true in component AGG-Agent
</pre>
As above, just be sure to edit your recipe in the ConfigurationBuilder
and re-save it.
</li>
<li>
Bug 1590: Extensive Name Server processing load<br>
Diagnosis: Excessive fetching of (topology entity) attributes to
implement Syscond topology polling. The algorithm is changed to be
O(N^2). Still not scalable, but blows up less rapidly.
</li>
<li>
Bug 1607: Blackboard timstamp service<br>
The Timestamp service was erroneously reporting "unknown" for all
timestamps. This is now fixed.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Issues:</h2>
 
<ul>
   <li>The <tt>org.cougaar.core.persist.NonPersistable</tt> interface has
been removed. This interface existed (in various packages) since an early
implementation of persistence (over four years ago). It managed to survive
through succeeding development despite that fact that it did nothing. Because
it was attracting the attention of developers and being used (and failing
to do what was expected), we decided to to remove it. This uncovered additional,
non-functioning, uses. Use the <tt>org.cougaar.core.persist.NotPersistable</tt>
 interface to mark classes whose instances should <i>not</i> be saved in
persistence snapshots. </li>
   <li>CSMART Agent Insertion recipes exported from any release prior to 9.4 
will give errors on importing into a 9.4 CSMART. These errors will be 
something like:
<pre>
11:48:17,870 ERROR [AgentInsertionRecipe] - Unknown property: Include Item Identification PG=true in component AGG-Agent
11:48:17,877 ERROR [AgentInsertionRecipe] - Unknown property: Include OrgAsset=true in component AGG-Agent
</pre>
Agent Insertion recipes in 9.4 <i>must</i> include an OrgAsset. So after 
importing your recipe, edit it, and fill out the newly required fields:
ItemIdentification, TypeIdentification, etc, if you have not already 
done so. See bug 1594 and the discussion of bug 1596 above..</li>
</ul>
  
<h2>New Bugs:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>cougaar bug 3675: CircularQueue.toArray incorrectly copies
	elements, causing occasional NPE in topology code on startup.  See bug for fix or ask for a patch release. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
