<h1>Errata for Cougaar 9.4</h1>
 <br>
 <i>The following infos/problems/workarounds were detected/posted after the
current version of Cougaar was built/released.<br>
 </i><br>
 
<h2>Issues:</h2>
 
<ul>
   <li>The <tt>org.cougaar.core.persist.NonPersistable</tt> interface has
been removed. This interface existed (in various packages) since an early
implementation of persistence (over four years ago). It managed to survive
through succeeding development despite that fact that it did nothing. Because
it was attracting the attention of developers and being used (and failing
to do what was expected), we decided to to remove it. This uncovered additional,
non-functioning, uses. Use the <tt>org.cougaar.core.persist.NotPersistable</tt>
 interface to mark classes whose instances should <i>not</i> be saved in
persistence snapshots. </li>
   <li>CSMART Agent Insertion recipes exported from any release prior to 9.4 
will give errors on importing into a 9.4 CSMART. These errors will be 
something like:<pre>
ERROR [AgentInsertionRecipe] - Unknown property: Include Item 
Identification PG=true in component AGG-Agent
11:48:17,877 ERROR [AgentInsertionRecipe] - Unknown property: Include Org
Asset=true in component AGG-Agent</pre><br>
Agent Insertion recipes in 9.4 <i>must</i> include an OrgAsset. So after 
importing your recipe, edit it, and fill out the newly required fields:
ItemIdentification, TypeIdentification, etc, if you have not already 
done so. See bug #1594.  See also below.</li>
</ul>
  
<h2>New Bugs:</h2>
 
<ul>
   <li>Bug 1596: CSMART Agent Insertion recipe creates bad Agents. At runtime, you will get exceptions, because the OrgAssets it creates lack ClusterPG and ItemIdentifificationPG. This will be fixed for 9.4.1
   </li>
 
</ul>
