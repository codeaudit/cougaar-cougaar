<h1>Errata for Cougaar 11.0.0 </h1>
<br>
<i>The following infos/problems/workarounds were detected/posted after Cougaar 11.0.0 was released.<br>
</i><br>
<h2>Issues:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The posted Cougaar 11.0 release (.zip) will not run societies from CSMART using the default global command line arguments. This has been fixed in the installers and in CVS. When using the posted .zip build to run from CSMART, a work-around is to edit the default agent start time argument in the Experiment Builder to remove the time component.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>New Bugs:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3499: If an organization's superior is killed & restarts such that it's GLS task is
temporarily removed for reconciliation, the OplanReaderPlugin can get an NPE.</li>
</ul>
