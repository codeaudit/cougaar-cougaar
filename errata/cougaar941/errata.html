<h3>Persistence/Rehydration bugs:</h3>
     The following bugs were observed while persistence was enabled and a supply point agent (47-FSB) was killed and then restarted.   Although the behavior of all agents was not characterized, we expect most "supply thread" agents to exhibit similar behavior as they contain a similar complement of plugins.   Upon rehydration the following known bugs occur:
<ul>
  <li>Bug #1847 - After persistance, no servlet response<br>
  </li>
  <li>Bug #1850 - During rehydration - Illegal rescind of a task that is connected to a workflow<br>
  </li>
  <li>Bug #1938 - Upon 47-FSB rehydration, negative days_spanned ERROR at 123-MSB<br>
  </li>
</ul>
     These bugs occured after quiescence, but 1847 and 1850 were also observed while restarting in the midst of processing.
