<h1>Errata for Cougaar 9.4.1</h1>
<br>
<i>The following infos/problems/workarounds were detected/posted after Cougaar 9.4.1 was released.<br>
</i><br>
<h2>Issues:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>none so far</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>New Bugs:</h2>
<h3>Persistence/Rehydration bugs:</h3>
     The following bugs were observed while persistence was enabled and a supply point agent (47-FSB) was killed and then restarted.   Although the behavior of all agents was not characterized, we expect most "supply thread" agents to exhibit similar behavior as they contain a similar complement of plugins.   Upon rehydration the following known bugs occur:
<ul>
  <li>Bug #1847 - After persistance, no servlet response<br>
  </li>
  <li>Bug #1850 - During rehydration - Illegal rescind of a task that is connected to a workflow<br>
  </li>
  <li>Bug #1938 - Upon 47-FSB rehydration, negative days_spanned ERROR at 123-MSB<br>
  </li>
</ul>
     These bugs occured after quiescence, but 1847 and 1850 were also observed while restarting in the midst of processing.
<p>

<h3>Restart reconciliation bug:</h3>
This bug occurs if an agent runs with persistence, is killed, and then restarted and rehydrated with its prior state.  The restarted agent only reconciles its blackboard with the agents that exist at the restart time, and fails to reconcile with agents that are created afterwards.
<p>
This is bug #1936, which will be fixed in the next release.
<p>

<h3>Windows AppServer kill doesn't automatically kill child processes:</h3>
Bug #1662 is due to a Windows JVM change from JDK 1.3 to 1.4.  If the user "CTRL-C"s an AppServer that is currently running nodes, these child nodes are not automatically killed by the dying AppServer JVM process.
<p>
Before killing an AppServer, Windows users should be careful to either make sure that CSMART has killed all the nodes on that AppServer.  The Windows TaskManager can also be used to check for running "zombie" nodes and kill them.
