<i>The following infos/problems/workarounds were detected/posted after

<br>
<h2>Issues:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug 3918:
      Java 1.5 prints an error:<pre>
        ERROR [XMLComponentInitializerServiceComponent] - 
          Unable to load XMLComponentInitializer
        ..
        Caused by: javax.xml.transform.TransformerException: line 55:
          Variable 'wpserver' is multiply defined in the same scope.
      </pre>
      See the above bug report for a one-line fix to the
      "configs/common/SimpleAgent.xsl" template file.
  <li>Bug 3726:
      If a target of your relay is an ABA, it is possible to get a
      flood of messages. To avoid problems, ensure that the targets list
      at the target agents is empty, or your Relay.Target
      implementation is a different class than your Relay.Source.</li>
  <li>Bug 3782:
      If you restart a society from persistence, some odd "orphan"
      tasks seem to appear. This is very rare.</li>
  <li>Bug 3881:
      INI file support will likely be dropped for release 12.0.</li>
  <li>Bug 3907:
      Replicated WP servers may fail to find their peer servers at
      startup.  This can occur if the initial WP server entries
      contain partial information, for example if they are non-empty
      but lack the required MTS certificate fields.</li>
</ul>
